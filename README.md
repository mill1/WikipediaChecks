# WikipediaChecks
Website that compiles statistic data on Wikipedia deaths list pages.

This utility site assists me in my endeavour to improve the quality of the [Deaths per month articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_deaths_by_year) on Wikipedia.
It generates statistical overviews per list article or for all twelve articles regarding a specific year. It focusses on the occurences of references per day in the list articles.
